Task 1: Student Score Prediction
This project was completed as part of my internship at Elevo. The objective was to build a machine learning model to predict students' exam scores based on various performance factors.

📁 Dataset
Source: Student Performance Factors (Kaggle)
The dataset contains information about students' study habits, sleep, attendance, and previous grades.
🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
NumPy
🚀 Project Workflow
Data Loading & Cleaning:
Loaded the dataset and handled missing values using median imputation.
Data Visualization:
Visualized the relationship between 'Hours Studied' and 'Exam Score'.
Model Building:
Trained a Linear Regression model.
Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
Bonus:
Implemented Polynomial Regression.
Experimented with multiple features like Attendance and Sleep Hours.
